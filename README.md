## Hey 👋

I’m Leon, a Lead Product Designer with a background in engineering.

I work on complex, regulated legal-tech products at a global scale. Most of my work falls into UX leadership, strategy, design systems, and large data-heavy product ecosystems.

In my own time, I build side projects to experiment, stay sharp, and that let me explore modern web tech without too much ceremony.
